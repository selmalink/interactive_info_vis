          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong>
              The Cake Clock visualizes the passage of time through the metaphor of baking and celebration.
              It’s designed for people who enjoy creative, food-inspired representations of everyday routines.
              The visualization frames time as something that “builds” gradually, like the layers of a cake being
              stacked as minutes pass,
              inviting a more tactile and comforting interpretation of clock time.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong>
              I used three distinct visual elements to represent time: cake <em>layers</em> for minutes,
              <em>candles</em> for hours,
              and colorful <em>sprinkles</em> for seconds. The alternating frosting and sponge colors emphasize minute
              progression within each hour,
              while the candle count offers an intuitive reference to hours in a 12-hour cycle.
              The warm, off-white background and rounded shapes evoke softness and warmth, consistent with a baking
              theme.
              I also added slight motion in the candle flames and sprinkles to make the clock feel alive and playful.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Future work:</strong>
              I would like to experiment with making the cake layers correspond to 12-hour periods instead of minutes,
              or introduce a “baking” transition where the cake rises and colors brown over time.
              Another extension could include a user interaction where clicking the cake “blows out” the candles or
              resets the clock for the next hour.
            </li>

          <figcaption>
            Step 1 — initial concept and design. The first idea imagined time as a birthday cake, where candles
            represent hours,
            sprinkles represent seconds, and each circular layer corresponds to minutes. The concept emphasized time as
            a celebration and accumulation of moments.

            width="400">
          <figcaption>
            Step 2 — iteration after peer feedback. The second version simplified the cake to two layers and clarified
            how each
            time unit would animate — sprinkles flicker for each second, layers fill as minutes pass, and candles signal
            the current hour.
            The focus shifted toward visual rhythm and color play rather than realism.

            Step 3 — polished final version. The design unified all three encodings: candles for hours, cake layers for
            minutes, and sprinkles for seconds.
            The final layout balanced clarity and whimsy, translating the feeling of baking and celebration into a
            visual metaphor for passing time.

          <li><strong>Context:</strong>
            The Heatwave Clock represents time through the feeling of heat, inspired by baking and the warmth of an
            oven.
            It’s designed for people who find comfort in kitchen routines and the sensory rhythm of cooking.
            Instead of showing numbers, the visualization expresses time as energy in motion, using color and movement
            to convey the steady pulse of heat throughout the day.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong>
            I encoded the <em>hour</em> as temperature, using color to transition from cool blues in early morning to
            hot orange reds in the afternoon.
            The <em>minute</em> controls the wave amplitude, showing how air distortion grows as time passes.
            Finally, the <em>second</em> drives subtle horizontal motion, creating a continuous shimmer that evokes
            rising heat.
            These visual choices make time feel alive, as if it’s breathing through warmth and motion rather than
            ticking mechanically.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Future work:</strong>
            I would like to add interactive “oven modes” where pressing a key switches between ambient heat and baking
            temperatures.
            Another refinement could include gentle glow effects or ambient sound to deepen the sense of warmth and
            immersion.

          <li><strong>Context:</strong>
            The Radiating Heat Dial reimagines time as warmth rather than movement of hands or numbers.
            Inspired by the heat and rhythm of baking, it visualizes the passing of time through color, size, and subtle
            motion.
            Designed for a quiet, reflective kitchen setting, this clock captures how warmth builds and fades throughout
            the day,
            representing time as a living pulse rather than a mechanical cycle.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong>
            I encoded the <em>hour</em> as the circle’s size and color, expanding and shifting from cool blue at night
            to bright orange during the afternoon.
            The <em>minute</em> appears as a glowing outer ring that fills clockwise, representing gradual heat
            accumulation.
            The <em>second</em> is expressed through a pulsing inner light that blinks like an oven’s heating indicator,
            giving the visualization a calm yet steady rhythm.
            Together, these choices create an ambient, abstract sense of time that feels warm and alive.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Future work:</strong>
            I would like to add interactive color modes or user-triggered transitions that simulate different baking
            temperatures.
            Another idea is to explore sound design — soft hums or clicks that correspond to each second — to strengthen
            the sensory connection to time and heat.

          width="400">
        <figcaption>
          Step 1 — initial concept and design. The first idea started as a Retro Cooking Clock,
          with a traditional dial, numbered face, and oven-style pointer for hours. Early notes included a minute
          progress bar and a flashing light for seconds.
        </figcaption>

          width="400">
        <figcaption>
          Step 2 — iteration after peer feedback. Feedback encouraged simplifying and abstracting the design.
          The new sketch removed numbers and hands, shifting toward a single circle where color represents hour,
          and an outer ring encodes minutes for a cleaner, more conceptual representation.

          Step 3 — polished final version. The concept evolved into the Radiating Heat Dial,

          pulsing center light shows passing seconds.
